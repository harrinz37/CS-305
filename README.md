**Reflection**

*For this portfolio submission, I chose to include the completed Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report. This artifact highlights my ability to conduct a full vulnerability assessment and recommend secure coding practices.*

**Client Summary:**

*Artemis Financial was a fictional client needing help to secure their RESTful web application. They requested a vulnerability assessment to identify risks in their system and improve their software security posture. Their goal was to protect user data, ensure compliance, and maintain business integrity.*

**Reflection on Work:**

*When finding security vulnerabilities, I believe I did well by using a structured approach that combined manual code review with static analysis using dependency-check. Coding securely is essential because it helps prevent data breaches, safeguards user information, and protects the company's reputation. Secure software strengthens a company's operations and customer trust.*

*The most challenging and helpful part of the assessment was filtering relevant vulnerabilities from the automated tool results and deciding which ones needed immediate attention. I increased layers of security by recommending input validation, encryption of sensitive data, and the use of HTTPS. In future assessments, I would continue using static analysis tools alongside manual reviews and refer to vulnerability databases like NVD to guide mitigation decisions.*

*To ensure the application stayed functional and secure after refactoring, I reran unit tests, rescanned with security tools, and manually reviewed code changes to check for newly introduced vulnerabilities. Resources like OWASP Dependency-Check and secure coding practices from OWASP Top Ten were particularly helpful and will be valuable in future assignments and real-world tasks.*

**Portfolio Value:**

*This vulnerability assessment report demonstrates my ability to assess software security risks, apply mitigation techniques, and professionally communicate findings. I would confidently share this artifact with future employers to showcase my skills in secure software development and vulnerability management.*
